# face_id: Face Recognition Using One-Shot Learning

## Overview

This project implements a face recognition system using Siamese Neural Networks inspired by the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition". The model uses one-shot learning to recognize faces by comparing image similarities, making it suitable for applications with limited samples per individual.

## Methodology

- **Face Detection**: Uses **OpenCV's Haar Cascade** to extract face regions.
- **Model Architecture**: Siamese Neural Network with convolutional layers and contrastive loss to learn embeddings for face similarity.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train with contrastive loss to optimize similarity metrics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV** for face detection
- **Streamlit** (planned for deployment)

## Features
- **One-Shot Learning**: Recognize faces with minimal samples.
- **Siamese Neural Network**: Learn discriminative embeddings.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Planned web interface for easy face verification.

## Project Roadmap

1. **Implementation**: Train Siamese Neural Network with PyTorch.
2. **Evaluation**: Test on various face datasets.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy with Streamlit.
